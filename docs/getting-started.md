## Troubleshooting
- **UWF not found:** Your Windows edition may not support it, or the feature is not installed
- **Changes not saved after reboot:** UWF discards changes unless files or registry keys are committed
---
## Best Practices
- **Backup:** Always back up registry keys or files before commiting changes
- **Use menus carefully:** Avoid unprotecting critical volumes accidentally
